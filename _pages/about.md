# {{ site.title }} 

I graduated from Morehouse College in 2021 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics and am currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in the [SUPERgroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) under the advisement of [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/). My research interests include security, privacy and human's interactions machine learning and artificially intelligent agents. Most of my specific interest is in research in these areas that support marginialized communities.
