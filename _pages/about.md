### {{ site.title }} 

I graduated from Morehouse College in 2021 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in [SUPERgroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) working with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).

I am building interfaces that help illuminate fairness‑related decisions throughout the data science process and creating data‑processing techniques that operationalize theories of justice by incorporating knowledge of systemic inequalities.

Technology has historically found many new ways to oppress, harm and exploit marginalized peoples and my goals are to focus on supporting and developing outcomes that result in tangible benefits for those who are most negatively affected by the current trajectory of technology, governmental policies and society.


#### Other things I'm interested in:
- algorithmic audits as a means of implementing accountability
