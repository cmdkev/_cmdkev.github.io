### {{ site.title }} 

I graduated from Morehouse College in 2021 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Chicago in [SUPERgroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) working with [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).

I'm interested in **privacy**, **security**, and **HCI** especially as these relate to **Machine Learning algorithms** and their interactions with **marginalized communities**. 
Technology has historically found many new ways to oppress, harm and exploit marginalized peoples and my goals are to focus my research on supporting and developing outcomes that result in tangible benefits for those who are most negatively affected by the current trajectory of technology, governmental policies and society.
This focus is largely driven by my skepticism of the lucrative business of mass surveillance through data collection and automation through Machine Learning algorithms.

Currently, I am very interested in:
- *currently working on*: algorithmic audits as a means of achieving these outcomes (in the spirit of Gender Shades)
- *currently working on*: helping data scientists/data workers understand critical aspects of their data and machine learning algorithms in order to make informed decisions about fairness while working
- making algorithms understandable/explainable/interpretable for the audience who uses them to make critical decisions
